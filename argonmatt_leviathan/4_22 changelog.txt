4.22 Changelog for Argon Leviathan

- Added German Language for extension description, and ingame description. (Via Google Translate, apologies if there are some mistakes)
- Added Ability for NPC AI to use 1x Leviathan as part of the main patrol fleet in Argon Prime. (A Leviathan should spawn instantly upon 
	new game creation. For existing save-games, it may take a while for the Argons to build up enough resources to construct a new Leviathan)

Thanks everyone :-)
